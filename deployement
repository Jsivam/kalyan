Query:Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.

  Ans:

step1: deployement with 1 replica

            apiVersion: apps/v1
          kind: Deployment
          metadata:
            name: kubia
          spec:
            selector:
              matchLabels:
                app: kubia
            replicas: 1
            template:
              metadata:
                name: kubia
                labels:
                  app: kubia
              spec:
                containers:
                - image: luksa/kubia:v1
                  name: nodejs
          ---
          apiVersion: v1
          kind: Service
          metadata:
            name: kubia
          spec:
            type: ClusterIP
            selector:
              app: kubia
            ports:
            - port: 80
              targetPort: 8080




      step2:making sure that there is zero downtime.

                  kubectl patch deployment kubia -p '{"spec": {"minReadySeconds": 10}}'

    step 3:    (steps needed to update a container's image using deployment)    
              
                kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2
                kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v3
