Query:
You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port.
Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue

Answer:
1. Node port .yaml file does not configure with correct Target port which is mentioned  application images( eg: in application mentioned as 8000 but in nodeport.yaml mentioned as 8080 for target port)
2. Node port .yaml file does not configure with correct NODE port which is used with public IP ( eg: in node.yaml file mentioned as 30001 in node port  but in  web browser used public ip: with port 30100 port (other than node port)
3. Mapped selector app in node port.yaml is not installed/ not correct. eg: node port is having mapped with kubia app selector  but the kubia pod is not installed. or app selector name is wrong
4. kind:service may not create properly with Type: node port that time we may not able to access the application  through node port
